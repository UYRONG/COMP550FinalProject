# Author Profiling based on Time-sensitive Lexical Behavior
This is the final project for COMP 550 Fall 2021.
We aim to analyze how language use has evolve over time and whether current 
machine learning models to detect the subtle differences in the writing
styles of authors from different generations.

We include a small sample of the dataset in the `sample_dataset` folder. The original whole dataset is used in Johns et al. (2019) _(Brendan T.Johns and Randall K.Jamieson. 2019. The influence of place and time on lexical behavior: A distributional analysis. In Behavior Research Methods 51, pages 2438-2453)_.
